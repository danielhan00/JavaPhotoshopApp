Assignment 6 USEME - Daniel Han, Matt Kugler

1. The commands supported by this application are as follows: 
    Create (Layer #) - adds a new empty layer to the current temporary list of layers being used by the application.
    Current (#) - Select the layer to be worked on.
    Load (FileName) - verify the file type of a provided image file, verify that the size of the file is the same as previous layers, add the image to the list of layers that can be selected and manipulated.
    Draw (checkerboard size numberOfTiles) - Create and set our current image to a programmatically generated checkerboard.
    Blur/Sepia/Greyscale/Sharpen - Apply the desired filter to our current image.
    Save (FileName) - Save the current file to the system with the desired name/type, add the image to the layer list, add the image name to the list of names, add the image name to the building master file name.
    Invisible (#) - Swap the invisible boolean for a layer. A layer is composed of an IImage object and a boolean to indicate if it is visible to the user.
    Done - Causes the program to terminate, the saved layers are added to a directory with a Master Text File that maintains the ordering of the layers. 

2. When first running the application, the user will be prompted to type "manual" to denote they will be entering commands interactively, or enter a file name (x.txt) which contains pre-written commands to be executed.
3. Command Ordering:
    1. Create (#) should be the first command, and before selecting a layer and loading a file, there needs to be enough layers present to accept the file. 
    2. Load (FileName) will set the current image to the image generated by parsing the file input. A desired filter modification should be done after this command. 
    3. Save (FileName) will save the current (modified) image as the name and file type provided by the user (Ex. KoalaSharp.png). 
    4. Done will terminate the program when there are no more commands be be given. 
    5. Example Command Script: 
	create layer 1 #Create a first layer to store an image. 
	create layer 2 #Create a second layer to store another image. 
	current 1 #Select the first layer to work with.
	load Koala.ppm #Load Koala.ppm into the first layer. 
	greyscale #Apply the greyscale filter to the first layer. 
	save koalaGrey.jpg #Save the selected layer as a koalaGrey.jpg file. 
	current 2 #Select the second layer to work with. 
	load Koala.png #Load Koala.png into the second layer. 
	sharpen #Apply the sharpen filter to the second layer. 
	save koalaSharp.png #Save the selected layer as a koalaSharp.png file. 
	invisible 2 #Make the second layer in the LayerList invisible (This will be applicable with future functionality, invisible layers are not visible to the user.)
	done #Terminate the application, create the directory of layers and the Master Text File.
